# Numerical-Integration

This is a java program to perform integration of a hard-coded function. It's not currently commented in any way, so sorry about that - I neded to finish a report on it. I'll comment it and java-doc it at some point.

To use, use `javac *.java` to compile, and `java NumericalIntegration -h` to start.

Also inculded is a stats program I wrote, and a batch file to glue the two together for my experiments.
